# CYBR-271
A repository storing all of my assignments from CYBR 271 (Secure Programming) at Victoria University of Wellington

## Assignment One

The first assignment for the course involved a vending machine and how its vulnerabilites can be exploited. Threat modelling (STRIDE) and risk assessment (DREAD) techniques were used to determine the vending machine's vulnerabilities and potential attack scenarios. I received high marks from the tutors for my attention to detail in outlining both the vulnerabilities and scenarios.

## Assignment Two
The second assignment for the course was split into two. I received very high marks for my attention to detail in documenting what happened as I executed each attack.

### Buffer Overflow Attack
This part of the assignment taught me how to execute a Buffer Overflow attack. I ended up executing the attack in a remote CLI by overflowing memory fragments that were not meant to be modified intentionally or unintentionally.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack
This part of the assignment taught me how to execute a Buffer Overflow attack. I ended up creating a worm virus similar to that of the Samy worm that affected MySpace.
